Supply Chain Management Project using Blockchain - RUSHABH GUNJAL

As part of an advanced project, I developed a Supply Chain Management system leveraging blockchain technology to enhance transparency, security, and efficiency in tracking goods from origin to destination. Key aspects of the project included:

Design and Implementation: Designed a decentralized application (DApp) on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling secure and immutable recording of supply chain transactions.

Smart Contracts: Developed smart contracts to automate and verify transactions between parties, reducing the need for intermediaries and minimizing the risk of fraud.

Transparency and Traceability: Implemented features to provide real-time tracking and traceability of products, allowing all stakeholders to access accurate and tamper-proof data regarding the movement and status of goods.

User Interface: Created a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to easily interact with the blockchain system, view transaction history, and monitor supply chain activities

This project provided valuable insights into the application of blockchain technology in supply chain management, demonstrating its potential to revolutionize the industry by increasing efficiency, reducing costs, and ensuring product authenticity.
